The ThunderCats, and Mumm-Ra as well, were shocked to see Vultureman's
flying machine coming to assist Mumm-Ra. And then, they all were yet more
surprised to find that Vultureman was nowhere to be seen. Cheetara was
piloting the flying machine. With its talons, she pick up the mummy and
dropped him from high up in the sky. Already weakened by Lion-o, the
ThunderKittens, and Tygra, he did not have the strength to fly, and he
hit the ground, sending up a cloud of sand.
