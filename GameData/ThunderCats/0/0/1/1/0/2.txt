The lord of the ThunderCats raised the sword above his head,
and shouted, "Thunder, thunder, thunder, ThunderCats ho!"
From all directions the ThunderCats came to his aid, finding
him now outside, battling Mumm-Ra before the Black Pyramid.
Wilykit and Wilykat arrived on their spaceboards first casting
exploding capsules at the mummy's feet.
