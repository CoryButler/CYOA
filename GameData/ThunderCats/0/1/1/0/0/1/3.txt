Jackalman heard Tygra's voice again, this time
further away near the sky cutter he had flown
to reach the cliff earily in the day. "It looks
like I'm need elsewhere," said the invisible
ThunderCat, and with that, the sky cutter appeared
to lift off the ground all on it own and flew
through the air toward the Cats' signal. Jackalman
would have to walk home.
