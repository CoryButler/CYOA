CM Staff,

All Cell Maintenance employees are welcome to enter the raffle. The winner will receive 30 vending credits. There
is no entry fee.

Best of luck,

P.S. These machines were installation with Cell Maintenance staff in mind. There is no need to return to the main floor
during your regular working hours.
