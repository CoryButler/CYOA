Tygra reached down and grabbed both of Jackalman's hands,
but he did not pull him up. He place his hands back on
the cliff's edge, and walked away. Again the Mutant begged
for help, but after a short time, instead of pleading,
Tygra heard a fearful scream as Jackalman's grip gave way,
and he fell to the stony floor below.
