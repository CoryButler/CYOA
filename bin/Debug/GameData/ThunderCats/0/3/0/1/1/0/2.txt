at the Wollo village. As she stepped off Wilykit's
spaceboard, a lion's roar called out and the Cats'
signal shone in the sky. "We've got to go," said
Wilykit. "Just remember when you're traveling, do
what we do: always travel with a friend." She winked
at her brother, and they fly off toward the signal.
