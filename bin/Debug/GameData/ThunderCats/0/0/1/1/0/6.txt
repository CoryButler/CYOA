The wicked mummy staggered to his feet and fled back into
the Black Pyramid. Just then, the Thunder Tank rolled up
to meet the ThunderCats. Panthro leapt into the midst,
nun-chucks in hand. "Hey, what's going on here?" he asked.
"Where's Mumm-Ra? I was looking forward to rattling that
old villains bones."
Snarf popped his heads out of the back of the Thunder Tank.
"Yeah," he said, "don't tell us we miss all the action."
At this all the ThunderCats, even Snarf, had to laugh.
